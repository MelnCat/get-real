A card game with custom pickup cards, multiple different decks, and rules that people _actually_ play with:

-   You can play multiple cards in one turn, given that they have the same number or symbol.
-   You can stack pickups to avoid picking up and pushing it to the next person.
-   Points? What are those? Winners are determined by order of finishing.
-   There is no player limit in either direction. You can play solo if you want! Not sure why you'd do that though.
-   Pickups don't skip player turns. The skip card exists for a reason.

Get Real offers several different decks to choose from:

## Original
